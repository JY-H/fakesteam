        <h3 class="game-description">TOM CLANCY: THE DIVISION</h3>
        <h6>GENRE: RPG | GAMEPLAY: SINGLE AND MULTI | OS: WINDOWS | PRICE: 59.99</h6>
        <h6 class="game-overview">We live in a complex world. The more advanced it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes. We have created a house of cards: remove just one, and everything falls apart. Black Friday â€“ a devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City, and one by one, basic services fail. In only days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, these agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society. When society falls, we rise.</h6>
